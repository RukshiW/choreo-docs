## 3. Fees and Payment

WSO2 may provide a basic tier that is free of charge. If you wish to use more features or higher capabilities, WSO2 also provides paid subscriptions for the Service. Pricing and payment plans for the Service are available at http://wso2.com/choreo/pricing. Fees are non-refundable and billed in advance at the frequency set out in your invoice or order. Your subscription period commences on the first day you access the Service with a paying account.

If you exceed the subscribed usage plan You will be charged for such excessive usage in accordance with WSO2’s records of your usage data and WSO2 will invoice you accordingly on the next billing cycle. You will not receive prior notification of your excessive usage or of the proportionate increase that will be reflected in your next invoice.

Upgrade of a subscription plan will be made effective immediately, but cancellations and downgrades will be made effective from the next billing cycle; accordingly no refunds will be offered.

You will be issued with receipts for payments made.

All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to these Terms, including without limitation, sales, service, use or value added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. **Taxes** means any form of taxation, levy, duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If you are required under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had you made no withholdings or deductions.

WSO2 reserves the right to change list prices and pricing plans in line with periodic scheduled price revisions. If WSO2 is of the view that such a change may adversely affect the plan you have subscribed to, you will receive thirty (30) days prior notice by e-mail of the proposed change.
