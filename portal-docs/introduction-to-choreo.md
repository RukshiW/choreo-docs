# About Choreo 

Modern-day developers face two main challenges. 

First, the complexity associated with their apps has increased. In the cloud, everything from building ad-hoc applications that integrate different systems to building enterprise applications that run securely and reliably at scale has become notoriously complex and hard. Developers now have to learn so much to get a simple application running efficiently in the cloud.  A modern-day cloud-native developer must be knowledgeable about Kubernetes, CI/CD, service-meshes, security, compliance, and so on. Tech giants such as Amazon, Netflix, Google have tamed this complexity; however, it took billions of dollars and thousands of hours of the smartest developer minds on the planet. 

Second, because competitive advantages are increasingly becoming digital, companies need more developers. Thus, developers' todo list keeps growing. 

Choreo is a platform that helps developers to rapidly develop, operate, and evolve cloud-native enterprise applications while taming the complexity. 

- It consists of an AI-assisted, low-code application development environment that helps developers to develop enterprise-quality apps faster while ensuring best practices and secure coding guidelines. Developers can switch between a visual low-code and typical code environment and select the experience that best supports a given situation.  

- Even without expert-level coding skills, Choreo's low-code environment enables developers to easily build applications. It also provides capabilities to collaborate and improve these applications as needed.  

- The low-code application development platform auto-generates editable and version-controlled code and maintains these in Git. This enables applying the engineering rigor required for enterprise applications on low-code. Thus with Choreo, the battle-proven software development lifecycle (SDLC) works like before. In contrast, SDLC does not work with many other low-code tools. 

- Choreo consists of deployment environments (Dev, Staging, Prod), CI/CD pipelines, and automation tests. It empowers developers to follow cloud-native deployment practices.

- The platform observes user applications, presents diverse information in context, and helps with troubleshooting, notifying developers when a system deviates from normal behavior This frees them from continuously having to watch systems.

- Choreo makes it possible to expose services professionally, with just a few clicks, through API management. It includes a developer portal, an API gateway, and other components to expose APIs securely, with strict governance.
